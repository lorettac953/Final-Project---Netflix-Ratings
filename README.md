Team 6:  Alexander San Filippo, Zach Snyder and Loretta Cortez

Objective:  Train a model using Netflix movie ratings that will allow us to develop an algorithm for providing movie recommendations.

Data:  Movie rating files for 17,000+ movie titles, over 100 million ratings from 480,000 random, anonymous Netflix customers.  Data was collected between 
October 1998 and December 2005. The ratings are on a scale from 1 to 5 stars.  

Utilizing Python Pandas, data was cleaned up to reflect only those fields desired for the model testing.

*** File sizes exceeded Github allowances, so files were
stored on Google Colab drive:  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AYoAIPK5G_vzh7Yu_U_Ap6DcFlYCSw6t
Jupyter notebooks are also stored on this Colab drive. ***

Python Scikit Surprise was utilized for modeling, using a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm.  We used a KNN algorithm to generate recommendations.

Please note, processing time for these models is extensive due to size of data files and limitations of processing resources.

See Powerpoint slides for details of project and recommendation samples.
