Team 6:  Alexander San Filippo, Zach Snyder and Loretta Cortez

Objective:  Train a model using Netflix movie ratings that will allow us to develop an algorithm for providing movie recommendations in a user interface.

Data:  Movie rating files for 17,000+ movie titles, over 100 million ratings from 480,000 random, anonymous Netflix customers.  Data was collected between 
October 1998 and December 2005. The ratings are on a scale from 1 to 5 stars.  

Utilizing Python Pandas, data was cleaned up to reflect only those fields desired for the model testing. File sizes exceeded Github allowances, so files were
stored on Google share drive:  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AYoAIPK5G_vzh7Yu_U_Ap6DcFlYCSw6t

Once data was cleaned, multiple testing models were created and tested so we could determine the model that was the best fit.
